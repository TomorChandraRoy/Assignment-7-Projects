# Added 3 project features:

- #### Usage of React Hooks:
 UseState and UseEffect hooks are used to manage application state. This allows the application to be more dynamic and responsive

 - #### Use of a JSON file: 
The data.json file is used to store the data for the courses. This makes it easy to update the data without having to make changes to the code.

 - #### Use of SweetAlert:
  The SweetAlert2 library is used to display alerts to the user. This can be used to provide feedback or to warn the user about errors.


# I used the useState hook to manage state in this project:

#### AllData: 
This is an array of all data. This is handled using a useState hook with an initial value of an empty array. Loading the data from a JSON file using the use effect hook.

#### SingleTitle: 
This is an array of data selected by the user. This is handled using a useState hook with an initial value of an empty array.

#### Remaining: 
This is the number of remaining credits for the user. This is handled using a useState hook with an initial value of 20.

#### TotalCoast: 
This is the total cost of the course selected by the user. This is handled using a useState hook with an initial value of 0.
